About
=====
inipp is a minimalistic ini style config parser for C++. It is contained
in a single header file which can be added to a programs source code. It
is intended for tools that need to read and parse (but not write) ini
style files and do not want to add a dependency to one of the more
advanced config parsing libraries.

Installation and Dependencies
=============================
Copy the ``inipp.hh`` header to a directory of your choice within the
sources of the software you intend to use inipp with. inipp requires
a C++ standard library with basic stream and string support and a C++
compiler able to compile said standard library and a one additional
class.

Example usage
=============
To read a config file create an instance of the *inipp::inifile* class
and pass it an *std::ifstream* object::
 
 #include "inipp.hh"
 #include <fstream>

 [...]

 std::ifstream cfstream("config.ini");
 inipp::inifile cfile(cfstream);

The constructor of *inipp::inifile* will read the given stream line
by line and parse it contents according to a set of rules:

- Empty lines, lines with only whitespace in them and lines starting
  a ``#`` character (and possibly whitespace before that) are completely
  ignored.

- Lines starting with a ``[`` character and ending with a ``]``
  (ignoring whitespace before and after) are taken as starting
  definitions of sections.

- Lines containing a ``=`` character and some none whitespace text
  before and after that character are assumed to be key, value
  pairs and are added to the current section. Whitespace next to
  the equal sign is trimmed.

- Any other lines are silently ignored.

Assuming a configuration file named ``config.ini`` with the following
content::

 everything = borked
 inipp = may not be borked

 [rule the world]
 use = lolcats en masse

 [sp3c14|_ c#4r4c73r2]
 do = work in inipp

Querying all these key, value pairs is as easy as calling the *get*
method on the *inipp::inifile* object::

 std::cout << "everything: " << cfile.get("everything")
           << std::endl
           << "inipp: " << cfile.get("inipp")
           << std::endl
           << "rule the world / use: " << cfile.get("rule the world", "use")
           << std::endl
           << sp3c14|_ c#4r4c73r2 / do: "
                                  << cfile.get("sp3c14|_ c#4r4c73r2", "do")
           << std::endl;
